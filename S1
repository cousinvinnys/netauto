Meadowlarks by Fleet Foxes
Fleet Foxes : Fleet Foxes (2008)

Meadowlark, fly your way down
I hold a cornucopia and a golden crown
For you to wear upon your fleecy down
A meadowlark sing to me
Hummingbird, just let me down
Inside the broken ovals of your olive eyes
I do believe you gave it your best try
A hummingbird sing to me
Mmmmmmm...
My hummingbird sing to me
